# Project: USART Half-Duplex transmission communication

## The aim
The main purpose of this application is to show how to establish UART communication in half-duplex mode using two Arduino Uno. The 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device is used here to analyze the UART signal. The Embedded C++ is applied to compile program in Arduino IDE 2.1.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Arduino Uno Rev3
      2- 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device
```
