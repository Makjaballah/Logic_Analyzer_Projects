# Logic_Analyzer_Projects

This is Logic Analyzer Projects repo. Without question, the most important tool you should obtain when working with signals such as UART, I2C, SPI, PWM and much more, is a logic analyzer device. In this repository, I will give some examples showing how to use the 24 MHz 8-channel Logic Analyzer Device and the Sigrok pulseview software to monitor and analyze signals.
