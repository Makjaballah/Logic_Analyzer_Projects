# Project: USB Logic Analyzer Device for monitoring a PWM signal

## The aim
PWM is a fundamental feature of any microcontroller (MCU). Popular use cases of PWM are to control motor speed or vary the brightness of an LED. The objective of this application is to show how to monitor the PWM signal features, such as frequency and duty cycle, using the 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device. The Embedded C++ is applied to compile program in Arduino IDE 2.1.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Arduino Uno Rev3
      2- 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device
      3- Oscilloscope
```
