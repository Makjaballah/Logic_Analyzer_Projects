# Project: DS18B20 digital temperature Sensor Interface with STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill

## The aim
DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor developed by Maxim Integrated. It uses one wire protocol. The DS18B20 digital temperature sensor has only three pins, two pins are supply voltage and one other is the data pin. The aim of this application is to read the temperature data from a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor and display it on an 16x2 LCD display with attached PCF8574 (I2C Module). The temperature data is printed on the serial monitor. The Embedded C is applied to compile program in Arduino IDE 2.1.
