# Project: DHT22 Data Logger with Arduino Uno Rev3 and MicroSD Card

## The aim
The DHT22 is an inexpensive sensor which measures relative humidity and temperature. It provides a calibrated digital output with a 1-wire protocol. It measures temperature and humidity with higher accuracy. The objective of this application is to show how to log temperature and humidity readings acquired from DHT22 sensor to a microSD card using Arduino Uno Rev3 and Arduino IDE 2.1. A Datalog.txt file is created in the microSD card module through programming the Arduino Uno Rev3 board and consequently log temperature and humidity readings to that file after every 3 seconds.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Arduino Uno Rev3
      2- DHT22 Sensor module
      3- MicroSD card module
      4- 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device
      5- Solderless breadboard
      6- Jumper wires
```
