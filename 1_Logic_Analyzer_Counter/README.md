# Project: Display a Counter on the Serial Monitor

## The aim

The aim of this application is to show how to use the 24 MHz 8-channel Logic Analyzer Device and the Sigrok pulseview software to monitor and analyze signals. In order to test the logic analyzer device, we used a simple code that allows to create a variable named counter, that is an integer and has a starting value of 0 then print the value of the counter variable on the serial monitor. The Embedded C++ is applied to compile program in Arduino IDE 2.1.

## Hardware Requirements

```
      1- Arduino Uno Rev3
      2- 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device
```
