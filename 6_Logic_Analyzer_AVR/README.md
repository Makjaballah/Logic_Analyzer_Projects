# Project: Analysis of UART Communication Protocol using a Logic Analyzer Device

## The aim
The universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter (USART), is a dedicated two-way port that transfers information from the Atmega328p microcontroller to a computer and allows the two to communicate. The USART permits the control of the Atmega328p microcontroller projects from a computer. It can help to debug these projects, by sending status reports from the Atmega328p microcontroller back to the computer to keep track of the code’s progress. The main object of this application is to show how to analyze UART signal using the 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device and the Sigrok pulseview software.
