# Project: USART simplex reception, simplex transmission communication

## The aim
The Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (USART) is a full duplex or half duplex or simplex transmitter or simplex receiver which can be used in synchronous or asynchronous serial communication mode and is used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. When USART (Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter) is used in the asynchronous mode it is called UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter). Simplex transmission or reception mode uses a single wire/pin in asynchronous mode. The aim of this application is to show how to establish UART communication in simplex mode using two Arduino Uno. The 24MHz 8-Channel USB Logic Analyzer Device is used here to analyze the UART signal. The Embedded C++ is applied to compile program in Arduino IDE 2.1.
